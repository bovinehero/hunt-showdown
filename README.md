### Fonts

For the headings font I selected __Crimson Pro__, as it is based on an updated version of the __Crimson Text__ serif typeface used on the Hunt Showdown [website](https://www.huntshowdown.com/).

This way I could keep within the theme of the site without directly copying it.

```
font-family: 'Crimson Pro', serif;
```

The font selected for the main body was selected for readibility, with a sans-serif being optimal for screens I selected __Open Sans__ as it designed for legibility across print, web, and mobile interfaces.

```
font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
```
